# ConfigReader
Robust configuration file reader class, with sample config and execution code.
<p>
Nobody really needs a configuration file reader, right??  Initially this began as a code test for a job.  
So, while there isn't a real practical application for the class, it has become a learning tool - a place to experiment 
or explore new features of the language.
